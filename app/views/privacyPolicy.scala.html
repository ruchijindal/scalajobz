			<p>ScalaJobz is committed to protecting the privacy needs of
				children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active
				role in their children's online activities and interests.
				ScalaJobz's services and this Site are not intended for and may not
				be used by children under the age of 13. ScalaJobz does not target
				its services or this Site to children under 13.</p>
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall
				Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's
				hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally
				do not permit us to personally identify you. Some advertisements
				that might appear on this Site are delivered to you by our
				advertising partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies
				to your computer. Doing this allows the advertising network to
				recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In
				this way, they may compile information about where you, or others
				who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine
				which advertisements are clicked. This information allows an
				advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they
				believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or
				control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party
				advertisers.</p>
			<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>
			<p>Our Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site,
				the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses,
				External Web Sites (defined below) linked to, search terms and the
				domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, and we may
				analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but
				such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate
				form only and it will not contain personally identifiable
				information. We also may collect aggregate labor statistics from
				public records. Such aggregate information is not linked to any
				personal information that can identify any individual person. We may
				use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer our
				Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic
				information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate
				information with third parties, including for various reasons
				related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements
				to appropriate audiences.</p>
			<p>We may disclose your aggregate information to our partner
				entities that provide job networking services to us to improve the
				content and general administration of our Site. In no way a
				peronally identifiable information would be shared.</p>
			<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
			<p>Our Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources
				over which ScalaJobz does not have control ("External Web Sites")
				through use of our APIs. Such links do not constitute an endorsement
				by ScalaJobz of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that
				ScalaJobz is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and
				further agree that ScalaJobz is not responsible for the content of
				such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject
				to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to
				External Web Sites.</p>
			<h3>Processing of Personal Information</h3>
			<p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States,
				so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data
				protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of
				protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European
				Union. If you create a user account with our Site as a visitor from
				outside the United States, by using our Site you agree to this
				Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such
				information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent
				level of protection of that required in the European Union or
				certain other countries, and to the processing of that information
				as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
